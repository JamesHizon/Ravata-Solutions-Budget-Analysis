# City of Davis Budget Analysis through Financial Forecasting (PYTHON)
Used Python and Excel to create graphs for budget analysis for the city of Davis.

As of 12/31, I am currently working on forecasting inside Python while working while manipulating data in the form of datetime objects. I want to work on forecasting through each type of budget. I may explore ARIMA model to work with rolling mean average and make the graph more smooth. I was able to fit a model and make predictions on a graph, but not the way I would have desired it to be.

The following our essential guides in my journey to become a predictive modeller with time-series data:

One package I found useful was: "Prophet". It reminds me of the Book of Isaiah, where we read about exact details of Jesus Christ's death and crucifixion offered to save humanity (Isaiah 53). In a way, the prophet package can be cool, because it is short depiction of how Christ's blood is sufficient to pay for an infinite debt of sin and Hell, and offer eternal "spiritual" savings. Likewise, prophet can help in reducing costs to various fields that may lead to debt inside the City of Davis or even suboptimal stewardship of resources.
