# City of Davis Budget Analysis through Financial Forecasting (PYTHON)
Used Python and Excel to create graphs for budget analysis for the city of Davis.

As of 12/31, I am currently working on forecasting inside Python while working while manipulating data in the form of datetime objects. I want to work on forecasting through each type of budget. I may explore ARIMA model to work with rolling mean average and make the graph more smooth. I was able to fit a model and make predictions on a graph, but not the way I would have desired it to be.

The following our essential guides in my journey to become a predictive modeller with time-series data:
